# Hidden Markov Decision Process for activity forecasting (2015)

This project aims to deal with the problem of predicting the behavior and decisions an agent will make via learning the past trajectories. It uses the Hidden Markov Decision Process model (HMDP) to simulate the decision making process of an agent. The project is a simplified version of the activity forecasting project (ECCV2012 http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kkitani/datasets/ ). Our goal is to provide the engineers/ researchers with a simple developing framework for testing their learning polices without a strong background in 3D-2D image projection, super pixel tracking, and semantic scene labeling. The c++ code has been rewritten into the scripting language. Experimental results show the convenience of our simplified framework and demonstrate the algorithmâ€™s efficiency in activity predictions.
